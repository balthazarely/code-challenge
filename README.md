### Challenges

I wasn't able to get the pagination to successfully re-calculate the pages after the filters had run, so the filtered results stay on the page they had originally been set on. You can see the results if you click through the paginated links.

I added a "Pagination On/Off" button, which toggles pagination and allows the user to see all the filtered results on the first page. This isn't ideal, but it helps to see the filters working without clicking through the paginated results.
